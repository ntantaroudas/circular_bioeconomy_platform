                  The Circular Bioeconomy SS designed by Alchemia aims to facilitate the transition to a circular
                  bioeconomy by providing the stakeholders of the MAP in Pongau with a comprehensive decision-making
                  support system/matrix tool. Advanced techniques such as mind-mapping of resource flows, multi-criteria
                  analysis, and material flow diagrams will be carried out to provide views and visualizations of
                  various circular bioeconomy scenarios that are of interest to the MAP. The simple-to-understand,
                  circular bioeconomy scenarios will be disseminated in a way that is useful for stakeholders who would
                  like to have detailed and understandable information on the sustainable management of natural
                  resources. Through detailed analysis and feedback mechanisms the SS identifies and evaluates potential
                  valorization pathways for different residue streams. In addition, it aims to facilitate the refinement
                  of bioeconomy scenarios based on stakeholder feedback and multi-criteria analysis. <br /><br />The SS
                  will promote sustainable regional development by highlighting the benefits of alternative valorization
                  pathways. Furthermore, by analyzing three specific residue streams such as ashes, sewage sludge and
                  food waste from hotels, valuable information on possible valorization pathways will be provided,
                  helping stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding resource utilization and will Illustrate how
                  these alternatives can positively impact the region, contributing to its economic, environmental, and
                  social sustainability. This approach aims to encourage the adoption of circular bioeconomy practices,
                  leading to reduced waste and enhanced resource efficiency in the area of Pongau.

                <p class="stackvectorfift__text--description ui text size-textxl">
                  Specific co-creation activities have been carried out between the SS provider (Alchemia) and Pongau
                  region MAP. During these activities it was identified that a significant challenge is the language
                  barrier, with a preference for the German language, highlighting the need for multilingual support. In
                  addition, several technical challenges have been identified regarding the selected residue streams.
                  These challenges include establishing conversion steps, addressing transport and logistics, sizing,
                  costs, and financing. Furthermore, in regions such as Pongau, engaging stakeholders effectively
                  presents an additional challenge. This issue however, is being effectively addressed through regional
                  governance partnerships. <br /><br />The emergence of residue fluctuates significantly due to seasonal
                  tourism and as a result flexible and adaptive management strategies are required to accommodate these
                  variations. During the development of the SS, several challenges have been encountered, including
                  difficulties in estimating the technical feasibility of alternative valorization pathways. This was
                  largely due to missing information regarding TRLs during literature researching in the existing state
                  of the art. <br /><br />Additionally, the main focus has predominantly been on developing a circular
                  bioeconomy pathway for the Pongau region, leaving less time to tackle challenges related to the online
                  tool itself and the development and integration of a material exchange platform to facilitate the SS.
                  To address these issues, solutions such as consulting regional experts and key stakeholders twice to
                  validate proposed pathways, and considering the use of existing platforms or flagship projects for
                  circularization of building materials have been examined. <br /><br />Despite these efforts, ongoing
                  and anticipated challenges persist, including translating the methodology to an online tool, engaging
                  all stakeholders effectively, and implementing the innovations. Interactions with MAPs have further
                  highlighted the challenge of aligning diverse stakeholder perspectives and integrating their feedback,
                  necessitating a continuous dialogue, iterative design updates, and a flexible framework to accommodate
                  evolving requirements and insights.

                  In the preliminary stages of co-creation activities with the Pongau Map, an analysis of the current
                  regional residue streams is carried out. This analysis involves specific inquiries into the origins of
                  the materials, their processing methods, and their end-of-life scenarios. On the basis of this
                  analysis, attempts are made to identify alternative valorization paths that can be used in conjunction
                  with the available system. Additionally, technological alternatives are assessed through comparisons
                  carried out based on different scenarios. <br /><br />These scenarios are formulated using matrices
                  and the comparison of mass flow diagrams is carried out to formulate coherent and easy to understand
                  potential scenarios. Subsequently, alternative circular solutions and valorization pathways are
                  developed. The focus is on the detailed analysis of individual residue streams, considering their
                  emergence, their composition, their quantity, and other key factors. However, one key constraint of
                  such analysis, is the data availability of these residue streams. As a result, engagement with
                  regional politicians, decision-makers, and industry stakeholders is necessary in order to overcome
                  this obstacle.

                    The development of the Circular Bioeconomy SS brings together a set of complex sophisticated tools
                    to facilitate decision-making within the circular bioeconomy domain. In particular the smart
                    solution includes the following key components within its architecture concept: <br />
                    <br />Process Charts as Mind-Maps: These charts offer a visual representation of resource flows,
                    allowing for intuitive understanding and analysis of the complex systems involved.
                    <br />Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA) Matrices: A structured approach to evaluate and compare the
                    performance of different circular bioeconomy scenarios against a set of predefined criteria is
                    provided through MCA Matrices. <br />Sankey Mass Flow Charts: Sankey mass flow charts are utilized
                    to easily visualize the flow of materials through various processes. Sankey diagrams allow key users
                    to visualize the efficiency and losses at each stage, offering a clear picture of material and
                    energy balances.

                    The architecture of the Circular Bioeconomy SS is designed to integrate the key components of the
                    circular bioeconomy SS shown in Figure into an inclusive modular platform. The system architecture
                    is structured under a layered framework as follows: <br />
                    <br />Data Input Layer: In the data Input layer, raw data on residue streams and process parameters
                    are collected and entered into the system. <br />Analysis Layer: In the analysis layer, mind-maps
                    are used for initial visualization purposes, MCA matrices are used for scenario evaluation, and
                    Sankey mass flow charts for flow analysis visualization and evaluation. <br />Output Layer: Detailed
                    reports, visualizations as well as useful insights from on the analysis layer are generated through
                    the output layer. <br />
                    <br />The systematic approach presented previously helps users and stakeholders to navigate through
                    complex data and derive meaningful insights to inform their decisions. One key feature of the
                    Circular Bioeconomy SS is its suitability for application in different regions. In particular, the
                    approach developed depends on circular economy and sustainability principles and can be implemented
                    in any region according to its conditions and specific use cases under examination. This
                    replicability is made possible through the flexible design of the mind-maps and MCA matrices, which
                    can be customized to incorporate local variables and criteria, as well as the ability to model and
                    visualize material flows specific to a region’s industries and resources using Sankey charts. This
                    replicability, combined with the specific tools and structured system architecture, makes the
                    Circular Bioeconomy SS a versatile and impactful tool in advancing the goals of the circular
                    bioeconomy, capable of addressing unique challenges and opportunities of diverse regions. <br />
                    <br />Specific requirements are derived and considered for the integration and compatibility of the
                    Circular Bioeconomy SS with other systems or platforms in order to ensure smooth functionality and
                    user experience. Integration requires the harmonization of data capture at the regional level
                    (NUTS3) with existing databases at broader levels (NUTS2 & NUTS1) [1], ensuring that our solution
                    can effectively communicate and utilize data from these sources. Additionally, exploring
                    compatibility with platforms like vcg.ai presents a potential exploration field to enhance the
                    SS&#39;s capabilities. On the compatibility side, the SS faces considerations with the production of
                    Sankey (material flow diagrams), which can be generated either through the e!sankey software [2], a
                    Windows-based application preferred for its ease of use, or via Python code, which necessitates
                    different Excel layouts. This dual-path approach necessitates careful planning to accommodate
                    users&#39; varying technical preferences and system requirements. <br />
                    <br />Regarding deployment, support, and maintenance, plans are underway to possibly have the Pongau
                    MAP host a building material exchange platform, which could significantly enhance regional circular
                    economy efforts. In addition, to improve open governance in Pongau district, it is being examined
                    the possibility of setting up a dashboard as a tool on the Pongau website (</span
                  >
                  <a href="#" class="stackvectorfift__text--description-span"> www.pongau.org</a>
                  <span>
                    ). This would provide an easy way to access information, also considering data from the Pongau MAP.
                    This deployment strategy, coupled with considerations for long-term service availability and
                    maintenance, will provide a sustainable and impactful solution that addresses the needs of the
                    Pongau region even beyond the end of the project. __</span
