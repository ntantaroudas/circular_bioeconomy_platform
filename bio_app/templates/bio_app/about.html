                  The Circular Bioeconomy SS designed by Alchemia Nova aims to facilitate the transition to a circular Bioeconomy by providing the stakeholders of Pongau with a comprehensive decision-making support system/matrix tool. Advanced techniques such as mind-mapping of resource flows, multi-criteria analysis, and material flows diagrams are carried out to provide views and visualizations of various circular Bioeconomy scenarios of interest for the area of Pongau. The simple-to-understand, circular Bioeconomy scenarios are disseminated in a way that is useful for stakeholders who would like to have detailed and understandable information on the sustainable management of natural resources. Through detailed analysis and feedback mechanisms the SS identifies and evaluates potential valorization pathways for different residue streams. In addition, it aims to facilitate the refinement of Bioeconomy scenarios based on stakeholder feedback and multi-criteria analysis.  Furthermore, by analyzing three specific residue streams such as ashes, sewage sludge and food waste from hotels, valuable information on possible valorization pathways are provided, helping stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding resource utilization and illustrates how these alternatives can positively impact the region, contributing to its economic, environmental, and social sustainability. This approach aims to encourage the adoption of circular Bioeconomy practices, leading to reduced waste and enhanced resource efficiency in the area of Pongau.

                  During co-creation activities, several challenges were identified in the implementation of the Circular Bioeconomy SS. Language barriers, especially the preference for German, posed a significant obstacle, requiring multilingual support. Additionally, technical challenges related to waste conversion, transport, and financing were encountered. Another critical challenge stemmed from the fluctuating nature of waste production, particularly due to the region's reliance on seasonal tourism. Flexible and adaptive management strategies were required to handle these variations effectively. Stakeholder engagement also emerged as a key challenge but was addressed through regional governance partnerships.

                  In the preliminary stages of co-creation activities with the Pongau MAP, an analysis of the current regional streams is carried out. This analysis involves specific inquiries into the origins of the materials, their processing methods, and their end-of-life scenarios. On the basis of this analysis, attempts are made to identify alternative valorization paths that can be used in conjuction with the available system. Additionally, technological alternatives are assessed through comparisons carried out based on different scenarios. 
                 <br><br>
                 These scenarios are formulated using matrices and the comparison of mass flow diagrams is carried out to formulate coherent and easy to understand potential scenarios. Subsequently, alternative circular solutions and valorization pathways are developed. The focus is on the detailed analysis of individual residue streams, considering their emergence, their composition, their quantity, and other key factors.  However, one key constraint of such analysis, is the data availability of these residue streams. As a result, engagement with regional politicians, decision-makers, and industry stakeholders is necessary in order to overcome this obstacle.

                    The architecture of the Circular Bioeconomy SS is designed to integrate the key components of the
                    circular bioeconomy SS shown in Figure into an inclusive modular platform. The system architecture
                    is structured under a layered framework as follows: <br />
                    <br />
                    - <strong>Data Input Layer:</strong> In the data Input layer, raw data on residue streams and process parameters
                    are collected and entered into the system. 
                    <br />- <strong>Analysis Layer:</strong> In the analysis layer, mind-maps
                    are used for initial visualization purposes, MCA matrices are used for scenario evaluation, and
                    Sankey mass flow charts for flow analysis visualization and evaluation. 
                    <br />- <strong>Output Layer:</strong> Detailed
                    reports, visualizations as well as useful insights from on the analysis layer are generated through
                    the output layer.
                    <br />
                    <br />The systematic approach presented previously helps users and stakeholders to navigate through
                    complex data and derive meaningful insights to inform their decisions. One key feature of the
                    Circular Bioeconomy SS is its suitability for application in different regions. In particular, the
                    approach developed depends on circular economy and sustainability principles and can be implemented
                    in any region according to its conditions and specific use cases under examination. This
                    replicability is made possible through the flexible design of the mind-maps and MCA matrices, which
                    can be customized to incorporate local variables and criteria, as well as the ability to model and
                    visualize material flows specific to a regionâ€™s industries and resources using Sankey charts. This
                    replicability, combined with specific tools and structured system architecture, makes the
                    Circular Bioeconomy SS a versatile and impactful tool in advancing the goals of the circular
                    bioeconomy, capable of addressing unique challenges and opportunities of diverse regions. <br />
                    <br />Specific requirements are derived and considered for the integration and compatibility of the
                    Circular Bioeconomy SS with other systems or platforms in order to ensure smooth functionality and
                    user experience. Integration requires the harmonization of data capture at the regional level
                    (NUTS3) with existing databases at broader levels (NUTS2 & NUTS1) [1], ensuring that our solution
                    can effectively communicate and utilize data from these sources. Additionally, exploring
                    compatibility with platforms like vcg.ai presents a potential exploration field to enhance the
                    SS&#39;s capabilities. On the compatibility side, the SS faces considerations with the production of
                    Sankey (material flow diagrams), which can be generated either through the e!sankey software, a
                    Windows-based application preferred for its ease of use, or via Python code, which necessitates
                    different Excel layouts. This dual-path approach necessitates careful planning to accommodate
                    users&#39; varying technical preferences and system requirements. <br />
                    <br />Regarding deployment, support, and maintenance, plans are underway to possibly have the Pongau
                    MAP host a building material exchange platform, which could significantly enhance regional circular
                    economy efforts. In addition, to improve open governance in Pongau district, it is being examined
                    the possibility of setting up a dashboard as a tool on the Pongau website (</span
                  >
                  <a href="www.pongau.org" class="stackvectorfift__text--description-span"> www.pongau.org</a>
                  <span>
                    ). This would provide an easy way to access information, also considering data from the Pongau MAP.
                    This deployment strategy, coupled with considerations for long-term service availability and
                    maintenance, will provide a sustainable and impactful solution that addresses the needs of the
                    Pongau region even beyond the end of the project. __</span

                  <p class="stackvectorfift__text--description ui text size-textxl">
                    The focus on vacant buildings emerged from the region's need for improved vacancy management tools. Instead of letting these spaces remain unused, the initiative aims to identify and categorize vacant buildings based on their potential for new uses, such as tourism or bioeconomy. This involves leveraging existing regional data to facilitate the repurposing of these buildings effectively. A capacity-building workshop with Pongau stakeholders explored barriers, drivers, needs, and best practices for vacancy management. Given the high regional priority for reutilizing and maintaining vacant buildings, efforts will be made to integrate this need into the Circular Bioeconomy Smart Solution. The categorization of vacant buildings for circular bioeconomy purposes will build upon existing research from ANRI and collaboration with the Pongau region.
                    The solution will be implemented within the Bioeconomy online platform, offering an interactive database that helps identify and activate suitable vacant buildings for circular bioeconomy applications. Additionally, it will enable communication with property owners through the regional channel of the Regionalverband Pongau, ensuring a streamlined approach to repurposing these spaces.                  </p>
